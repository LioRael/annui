# AnnUI

AnnUI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

## Philosophy

**High Customizability**: AnnUI inherits the design philosophy of shadcn/ui while retaining Radix UI's powerful declarative component design. This ensures our components maintain high customizability while providing an excellent development experience.

**Developer Experience**: Through declarative component APIs, developers can build interfaces more intuitively, reduce boilerplate code, and improve development efficiency. Additionally, based on Radix UI's accessibility support, our components are inherently accessible.

**Enhanced Animations**: We've enhanced many components with animations to improve user experience and create more engaging, dynamic interfaces. These thoughtfully designed animations help provide visual feedback and make interactions more intuitive and delightful.

AnnUI is heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [magicui](https://magicui.dev/).
